A game to see if you can crack the secret code!

Installing JavaFx and SceneBuilder to edited the source code:

This is only for Eclipse users:

Download the Eclipse IDE: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

Download and install Java JDK 8:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
                                There is ways to make JavaFX and Scenebuilder to work with the newer JDk but for most purposes JDK 8 
                                is more than enough.

Download, install and connect JavaFX to Eclipse:
                                                  Follow these steps - https://o7planning.org/en/10619/install-efxclipse-into-eclipse
                                                  Do exactly like the instructions say. Only thing to change is to use this URL instead:
                                                  http://download.eclipse.org/efxclipse/updates-released/3.3.0/site
                                                  
Download and install SceneBuilder: https://o7planning.org/en/10621/install-javafx-scene-builder-into-eclipse

Once you follow all those instructions you should be fine.
